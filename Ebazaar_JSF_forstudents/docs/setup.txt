How to set this project up in another workspace

0. This project uses the usual MySql database config -- just get MySql server running (you 
don't need to think about adding MySql as a datasource in glassfish)

1. Make sure latest version of glassfish is installed. Instructions for 5/2016
are in setup folder for this course

2. Create an empty dynamic web project -- as you go through the wizard,
you need to add one thing -- support for jsf2.2

3. Copy Java src packages directly into the Java Resources src folder

4. In WebContent:
  a. Copy the xhtml files directly
  b. copy the resources folder to the top level
  c. WEB-INF:  copy beans.xml, context.xml, and update web.xml with the last two tags of the file
  (most importantly, these tell JSF to use the index.xhtml as a welcome file)
 
5. jar files
  a. for compiling, you need to add these to the project as external jars in the usual way
  b. for deployment, you need to add these to WEB-INF/lib

6. You should be able to run it by right clicking on the project and "run on server" 
-- it won't look very good in the internal browser

7. copy the url into an external browser -- should look good
